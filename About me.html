<h1>About Me</h1>

<pr>
    I'm an aspiring web developer/ programmer from Jakarta Indonesia. At the moment <br>
    I'm 22 years old, currently a senior in college focusing on my thesis. <br>
    The reason that I'm learning wed development is mainly I saw that if you are able to have<br>
    A programming skill or at least an understanding of programming, it can open all sorts of Career choices for you.
    <br>
    Other than that, I've always been interested in technology, mainly on the side of programs, and how they worked.
    I figured that now would be a better time than any to start learning web development.
    <br>
    The main source I use to learn programming is mainly Udemy, as I believe the site has some of the best teachers a person could ask for, 
    I also ocasionally use Youtube, and other media, as a source for all my learning.
