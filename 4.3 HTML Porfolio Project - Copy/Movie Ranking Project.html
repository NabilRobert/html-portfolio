<h1>Best Movies According to Nabil</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Aquaman</h2>
<p>It was an okay movie, my friend persuaded me to watch this. It was an okay movie, it would be better if Amber Heard wasn't in it though.</p>
<h2>Driver</h2>
<p draggable="true">
    Way better than Fast and Furious, also directed by Walter Hill, I love the SFX they used back in the 70s.
</p>
<h2>Sweet Home</h2>
<p>One of my favourite horror movies, directed by one of the best directors ever, Walter Hill</p>
